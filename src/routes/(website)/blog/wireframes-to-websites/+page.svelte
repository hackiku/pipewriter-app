    content: `
      We just shipped something exciting: instant conversion from Google Docs wireframes to production-ready websites. No more hand-coding or back-and-forth with developers. Just write, structure, and convert.

      ## The Writer's Dilemma

      As writers in tech, we often start with the content first - using headings, paragraphs, and document structure to outline the user experience. But translating that into a working website usually means:

      1. Exporting to HTML (losing styling)
      2. Manual coding (time-consuming)
      3. Back-and-forth with developers (communication overhead)
      4. Multiple iterations to get it right (delays)

      ## The AI Bridge

      What if you could keep writing in Google Docs, using familiar tools and workflows, and then transform your content into a fully-styled website with a single prompt?

      That's exactly what our new AI conversion feature does:

      - Preserves heading structure for consistent styling
      - Converts document sections to semantic HTML
      - Adds Tailwind CSS classes for instant styling
      - Supports custom design instructions via comments

      ## How It Works

      The magic happens in three steps:

      1. Write your content using Pipewriter's pre-styled components
      2. Add design comments (optional) to guide the AI
      3. Convert to HTML with our specialized prompt

      The AI understands document structure and design intent, producing clean, production-ready code that doesn't need heavy refactoring.

      ## What's Next

      This is just the beginning. We're working on:

      - More design system options
      - Component library integration
      - Custom styling presets
      - Direct deployment options

      ## Join the Revolution

      We're in beta, offering special pricing for early adopters. Previous template users get 50% off - check your email for the discount code.
