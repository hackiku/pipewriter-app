## The First Launch (2023)

Two years ago, I made a Webflow template that let writers prototype websites in Google Docs. Nothing fancy - just a bunch of tables that looked like UI components. Put it up for free, forgot about it.

400 downloads later, I realized I had stumbled onto something. Writers were using my janky template for five-figure contracts. They were building entire UX workflows in _Google Docs_ of all places.

## Learning to Code (The Hard Way)

Here's where it gets weird. Instead of going deeper into no-code tools, I:
1. Started aerospace engineering
2. Got into pilot training
3. Learned to code (badly)
4. Failed a rocket motors exam (spectacularly)

Not exactly a traditional path to building writer tools. But there's this saying in engineering - the essence of it is making things do what they weren't supposed to do.

And Google Docs? It was never supposed to be a UX tool.

## The Writer's "Can It Run Doom?"

You know how devs try to run Doom on everything? Calculators, printers, pregnancy tests (yes, really). It's about pushing systems beyond their intended use.

That's what I did with Google Docs. It started with a simple question: "Can it prototype?"

Turns out, it can do a lot more:

```javascript
// What Google Docs was never meant to do
const sidebar = {
  width: "300px",  // All the real estate we get
  purpose: "design system",
  components: 90,
  status: "it actually works?!"
};
```

I built a tiny sidebar app that turns Docs into a full UX workspace. It's like Figma had a baby with a word processor, and that baby is really good at writing copy.

## From Zero to Launch

The rebuilt version just launched. It's still early days, but writers are doing things with it I never imagined:
- Building full design systems in Docs
- Running UX workshops entirely in Docs
- Converting copy decks straight to code

## Why It Works

The magic isn't in the technology. It's in understanding that writers need different tools than designers. We think in words first, visuals second. Every existing design tool gets this backwards.

```plaintext
Designer tools: Design → Add text
Writer tools:   Text → Add design
```

## What's Next

I'm still splitting time between coding and aerospace studies. Still failing exams occasionally. But this weird combination is actually perfect for building tools that do things they weren't supposed to do.

Next up:
- More components (aiming for 200+)
- AI conversion pipeline
- Maybe making Google Sheets run Doom (kidding... mostly)

Want to try it? Grab the early access at pipewriter.io. And if you're a writer who's ever looked at Figma and thought "there has to be a better way" - you're the reason I built this.

P.S. If anyone asks why I built a UX tool in Google Docs, just tell them: "Because it runs Doom." They'll understand.
