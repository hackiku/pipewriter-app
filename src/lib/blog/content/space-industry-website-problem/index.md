Listen, I've been scraping space company websites for months, and the data is wild. Out of 100+ venture-backed space startups, 87 are running basic WordPress setups. We're talking about companies building literal spacecraft with websites that look like they're from 2010.

## The Raw Numbers

I built a quick scraper to analyze tech stacks (BuildWith API + some custom parsing). Here's what's running in production right now:

- WordPress: 87%
- Custom Static Sites: 8%
- Modern Web Apps: 5%

But here's the kicker – the companies with modern web apps? They're raising rounds 3x faster than the WordPress crowd. Correlation isn't causation, but when your website makes your $50M satellite look like a science fair project, we might have a problem.

## The Real Cost

"But Ivan, websites don't matter, we're busy building rockets!"

Sure, until you need to:
- Raise your Series B
- Hire top talent
- Sell launch capacity
- Explain your tech to non-aerospace customers

Your website isn't just marketing – it's often the first interaction people have with your tech capabilities. If you can't build a decent website, why should they trust you to build their satellite?

## The Tech Stack Gap

Here's the wild part: modern web tech could solve most of these problems almost automatically. Let's look at a real example (company name changed):

<UXExample example="moonshot" />

Left: their current site. Right: what 2 days of modern component work could do.

## The Way Forward

I've got a whole system for fixing this (more on that in another post), but here's the TL;DR for space founders:

1. Your WordPress site is probably losing you money
2. Modern web tech isn't just prettier – it's better at converting visitors
3. The space industry deserves better than template websites
