Hey writers! Remember how we're using Google Docs for wireframes? We just made it a lot more fun. Your wireframes can now turn into actual working prototypes with some proper design flair.
<!-- <Disclaimer /> -->

## The New Stuff

You'll find three fresh design system UI kits in your Drive folder (under AI/Styles):

* **Cyberpunk**: Dark futuristic vibes with neon accents. For when your product needs to feel like it's from tomorrow.
* **Neobrutalist**: Bold, functional, high contrast. Because sometimes you need your design to punch first and ask questions later.
* **Vaporwave**: Retro-tech with gradients and chrome effects. The 80s called, they want their aesthetic back (but better).

They're built with Tailwind CSS and packed with AI-friendly comments. Use them as reference, inspiration, or to impress that designer friend who keeps sending you Figma tutorials.

## How to Use It

Super simple:
1. Find the "Pipewriter" menu in Google Docs (or tap the `</>` button in the app)
2. Convert your wireframe to HTML
3. Grab the master prompt doc from your AI folder
4. Use the prompts to generate variations or convert to other frameworks

Here's a quick example:

<CodeDemo language="markdown">
# Hero Section
## Main headline here
[Button: Get Started]

# Python comment: Display logos in 3x3 grid
[Logo][Logo][Logo]
</CodeDemo>

## One More Thing

We quietly launched a web editor at pipewriter.io that does the same Docs-to-code magic but right in your browser. Very early days, but feel free to play with it.

## Get Started

All of this is in your beta access already. Know other writers who'd dig this? The $59 launch price is still running ðŸ«¶

Questions? Hit me up. Let's see what you build.
