Remember that moment in a project when you hand over your carefully crafted wireframe to developers, and then wait weeks to see it come alive? Yeah, let's fix that. Today we're launching a feature that turns your Google Docs wireframes into working code – instantly.

## The Writer's Secret Weapon

Here's what makes this special: you don't need to learn Figma, master HTML, or leave Google Docs at all. The tool you use to write is now the tool you use to prototype.

<CodeDemo language="html">
<!-- Your wireframe in Docs -->
# Enterprise Analytics Platform
## Turn data into decisions
[Get Started]

<!-- Becomes production-ready HTML -->
<section class="hero">
  <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold">Enterprise Analytics Platform</h1>
  <p class="text-xl text-gray-600">Turn data into decisions</p>
  <button class="btn-primary">Get Started</button>
</section>
</CodeDemo>

## Three Design Systems, Endless Possibilities

With this update, you get three complete UI kits in your Drive folder (under AI/Styles):

1. **Cyberpunk**
   - Dark, futuristic aesthetics
   - Neon accent colors
   - Perfect for tech-forward products
   
2. **Neobrutalist**
   - Bold, functional design
   - High contrast elements
   - Ideal for standing out in a crowded market
   
3. **Vaporwave**
   - Retro-tech vibes
   - Chrome effects and gradients
   - When you want that nostalgic edge

Each kit is built with Tailwind CSS and comes loaded with AI-friendly comments. You can use them as reference, inspiration, or to flex on your design team (we won't tell).

## How It Actually Works

The magic happens in two clicks:

1. Open the Pipewriter menu in Google Docs (or use the `</>` button in the app)
2. Hit "Convert to HTML"

Behind the scenes:
- Our parser reads your document structure
- Identifies headings, sections, and components
- Converts them to semantic HTML
- Applies your chosen design system

Want to get fancy? Drop in Python-style comments to give the AI extra context:

<CodeDemo language="markdown">
# Hero Section
## Main headline goes here
[Button: Start Free Trial]

# Social Proof
# Python comment: Show logos in a 3x3 grid
[Logo][Logo][Logo]
</CodeDemo>

## The Secret Sauce: AI Prompts

In your AI folder, you'll find a master prompt document. This is your Swiss Army knife for:
- Converting sections to different frameworks
- Generating design variations
- Creating component libraries

The prompts are verbose by design – they ensure you get consistent, working results every time. Feel free to customize them for your specific needs.

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning. On our roadmap:
- Figma export support
- More framework templates (React, Svelte, Vue)
- Custom design system builder
- Direct deployment options

We've also quietly launched an early prototype of our web editor at pipewriter.io. It brings the same Docs-to-code magic to the browser. Very early days, but feel free to take it for a spin.

## Built for Writers, By Writers

Remember: the goal isn't to replace designers or developers. It's to give writers the tools to prototype their ideas quickly and effectively. Because when words meet working prototypes, magic happens.

The best part? All of this is included in your beta access. Still running our $59 launch price if you want to jump in or share with fellow writers.

## Get Started

1. Check your Drive folder for the new AI/Styles directory
2. Open any of your wireframes
3. Convert to HTML via the Pipewriter menu
4. Choose your design system
5. Watch your words come alive
