		question: "Why the heck do UX in Google Docs?",
		answer: "Because that's where We the Writers make the words happen. I couldn't stand clicking 5 times in Figma just to edit a headline (with no word counter to save my life). So I started making fancier and fancier wires in GDocs. Clients liked them, designers got a bit jelly, and I kept going. Now you can too."
	},
	{
		question: "What's a Pipewriter and why shoud I care?",
		answer: "The full writer-first wireframing system: 90+ UI components, pre-formatted documents with proper typography, and a bunch of styling scripts - all right where you write. This includes the sidebar app with one-click element insertion, light/dark themes, client-ready deliverables, and HTML export capabilities. It's my jar of hearts of ADHD scripts, hacks and tricks, productized for your writerly enjoyment."
	},
	{
		question: "Can I use this for client work?",
		answer: "Absolutely! That's exactly why I built it for myself. Clients immediately get the vision when they see the wireframe structure. Revisions become much easier or they don't even ask. The professional deliverables help you charge premium rates and reduce revision rounds - perfect for freelancers and agencies working on multiple client projects."
	},
	{
		question: "Is this just another no-code tool?",
		answer: "Nope! Most no-code tools are built for developers who don't want to code, not writers who need to prototype content. Unlike Webflow or Wix which focus on final websites, Pipewriter helps you create professional UX deliverables directly in Google Docs - the app you already use every day. Perfect for content strategy, UX writing, and those juicy five-figure copywriting projects."
	},
	{
		question: "How does the HTML export work?",
		answer: "Magic! (Okay, not really). Your wireframes are built with styled headings and tables. Pipewriter includes scripts to convert them to clean HTML that AI can understand. You can then use the included prompts to get AI help converting this code to a fully functional website. Add comments in your wireframe to increase precision, then export to HTML with a couple of clicks. I'm actively working on making this process even smoother."
	},
	{
		question: "Who is Pipewriter perfect for?",
		answer: "<ul class='list-disc pl-6 space-y-2'><li><strong>Copywriters</strong> – Level up from $500 to $5k+ projects with pro-grade deliverables that look as good as they convert.</li><li><strong>UX Writers</strong> – Break into tech without learning Figma. Create proper UX deliverables without touching code.</li><li><strong>Content Strategists</strong> – Lead with content-first design that doesn't look like an afterthought.</li><li><strong>Designer/Writer hybrids</strong> – Give UI-free wireframing a shot. Words first, pixels later.</li></ul>"
	},
	{
		question: "What's the difference between the addon and templates?",
		answer: "The Pipewriter addon lives in your Google Docs sidebar for quick access to all wireframe elements. Templates are pre-made document structures for specific uses (landing pages, full websites, product pages) that you can copy and customize. The addon helps you build from scratch, while templates give you a headstart with professionally structured documents."
	},
	{
		question: "Do I need design experience to use Pipewriter?",
		answer: "Not at all! Pipewriter is built specifically for writers who understand that words are the heart of product development. If you can use Google Docs, you can create professional wireframes with Pipewriter. The templates give you just the right amount of design thinking (without the design degree) - in a polished package clients will pay more for."
