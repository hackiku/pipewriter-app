		question: "Why build a UX tool in Google Docs?",
		answer: "Because that's where we writers already work! No need to click 5 times in Figma just to edit a headline (with no word counter to save your life). Pipewriter adds UX superpowers to your existing writing workflow, letting you create wireframes and prototypes without leaving your favorite text editor."
	},
	{
		question: "What exactly do I get with Pipewriter?",
		answer: "You get the full template system and Docs sidebar app, with 90+ UI components, pre-formatted documents, and a bunch of styling & conversion scripts - all bound to your documents forever. This includes wireframing tools, HTML export capabilities, and upcoming AI features. All in one Drive that I update regularly. Plus, you'll get direct support and free updates during the beta period."
	},
	{
		question: "Is this just another no-code tool?",
		answer: "No - Pipewriter is specifically built for writers who need to prototype and present content. Unlike Webflow or Wix which focus on final websites, Pipewriter helps you create professional UX deliverables directly in Google Docs. It's perfect for content strategy, UX writing, and high-value copywriting projects."
	},
	{
		question: "How does the HTML export work?",
		answer: "Select any section of your document and run our export script. It converts your wireframe into clean, semantic HTML with proper accessibility markup. This makes it easy to collaborate with developers or quickly prototype ideas. Perfect for going from copy doc to ~90% ready-to-deploy website."
	},
	{
		question: "Can I use this for client work?",
		answer: "Absolutely! Many writers use Pipewriter to level up from $500 to $5k projects. The professional wireframes and UX deliverables help you charge more and reduce revision rounds. It's perfect for freelancers and agencies - use it for as many client projects as you want."
	},
	{
		question: "What happens when you launch the add-on?",
		answer: "Early access buyers get the best deal! You'll keep lifetime access to all current features through the bound scripts, plus get several months of pro membership when we launch the official Google Docs add-on. The scripts are open-source, so you can even customize them."
