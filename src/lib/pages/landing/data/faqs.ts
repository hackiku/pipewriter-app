		question: "What's a Pipewriter and why should I care?",
		answer: "It's a writer-first wireframing system that lives where you already work: Google Docs. The sidebar app lets you instantly insert UI components, style headings, change background colors, manage tables, and prototype UX directly in your document. Battle-tested in roughly a decade of banging UX copy for SaaS, startups, techbros and design agencies."
	},
	{
		question: "Why the heck UX in Google Docs?",
		answer: "Because that's where We the Writers make the words happen. I couldn't stand clicking 5 times in Figma just to edit a headline (with no word counter to save my life), so I started making fancier and fancier wires in GDocs. Clients liked them, designers got a bit jelly, so I kept going. Now you can too."
	},
	{
		question: "How does the wireframing thing actually work?",
		answer: "Pure Google Docs magic – but actually just clever table formatting! Each element uses headings 1-6 for structure (which update globally if you change styles), carefully designed tables, and proper whitespace. No images needed, though you can Ctrl+C your own. One click inserts the element at your cursor position. Styling and conversion flows are neatly packed in tabs to speed you up to GDocs power user status without the tears. Plus, you can toggle between light and dark modes to match your design system."
	},
	{
		question: "What's included in the Pipewriter, uhm, ecosystem?",
		answer: "Disclaimer: contrary to every founder's desires, no user really uses the word 'ecosystem'. And yet we'll roll with it: <ul class='list-disc pl-6 space-y-2'><li><strong>The Sidebar App</strong> (freemium) – Google Docs add-on with wireframe elements and styling tools</li><li><strong>Pro Template Pack</strong> (single purchase) – 100+ additional wireframe elements in light/dark modes</li><li><strong>Template Store</strong> (when needed) – Specialized landing pages and document structures for specific industries</li></ul><p class='mt-4'>Think of it as different levels of wireframing power: the app gives you the tools, the template pack gives you extra building blocks, and the store gives you ready-to-customize layouts.</p>"
	},
	{
		question: "Can I use this for client work?",
		answer: "Does the Pope write conversion copy in the woods... for free? Didn't think so. Of course you can! That's why I built this for myself — to make $, raise rates, and make Figma pixel-peddlers tremble. You wouldn't believe the wow factor when clients see web copy that 'looks real'... without you having to teach them how to add comments. Certified to work across clients' tech literacy spectrum."
	},
	{
		question: "What's the difference between Free, Trial, Pro?",
		answer: "The <strong>free version</strong> includes the core add-on with 24 basic wireframe elements and all the styling and code conversion tools – daily workflow driver.<br><br>The <strong>Pro version</strong> ($10/month) unlocks everything: all 100+ wireframe elements, AI-powered HTML export, specialized prompts, background styling, and regular updates. Plus, Pro subscribers get first access to new features and priority support. <br><br>You start for free with a <strong>14 day trial</strong> for full access to the sidebar app (no credit card required). Just install the add-on, sign in, and you're in. Test all wireframing elements, AI prompts, HTML export, and styling tools. When the trial ends, you can continue with the limited free version, or upgrade for the full experience."
	},
	// {
	// 	question: "How does the free trial work?",
	// 	answer: "You get full access to the sidebar app full experience for 14 days (no credit card required). Just install the add-on from Google Workspace Marketplace and you're in. Test all wireframing elements, AI prompts, HTML export, and styling tools. When the trial ends, you can continue with the limited free version, or upgrade for the full experience."
	// },
	{
		question: "Tell me about the HTML export thing...",
		answer: "It's my favorite Pipewriter party trick! Since your wireframes use structured headings and clean formatting, they can be programmatically converted to HTML with a single click. The app then gives you options to:<br><br>1. Copy, insert or download the raw HTML code<br>2. Use built-in AI prompts to convert your wireframe to functional code with any AI chat you use<br>3. Add comments to the wireframe for more customized AI instructions <br><br>You can also save your own prompts. I've included specialist prompts optimized for different frameworks and use cases. One prompt, two clicks, and your wireframe becomes a functioning website. I'm a copywriter turned web dev, so these are workflows I use daily on client work. (Check the Loom video on the site for a quick demo!) "
	},
	// {
	// 	question: "Is Pipewriter for me? Is this who I am?",
	// 	answer: "If you have a body, you're an athlete. If you write even vaguely interactive web words for a living, Pipewriter is likely for you: <ul class='list-disc pl-6 space-y-2'><li><strong>Copywriters</strong> – Level up from $500 to $5k+ projects with pro-grade deliverables that look as good as they convert.</li><li><strong>UX Writers</strong> – Break into tech without learning Figma. Create proper UX deliverables without touching code.</li><li><strong>Content Strategists</strong> – Lead with content-first design that doesn't look like an afterthought.</li><li><strong>Designer/Writer hybrids</strong> – Give UI-free wireframing a shot. Words first, pixels later.</li></ul>"
	// },
	// {
	// 	question: "Is this just another no-code tool?",
	// 	answer: "Nope! Most no-code tools are built for developers who don't want to code, not writers who need to prototype content. Unlike Webflow or Wix which focus on final websites, Pipewriter helps you create professional UX deliverables directly in Google Docs - the app you already use every day. Going from copy doc to a website that's around 90% ready to deploy is the exact thing I've been looking for. Perfect for content strategy, UX writing, and those juicy five-figure copywriting projects."
	// },
	// {
	// 	question: "Do I need design experience to use Pipewriter?",
	// 	answer: "Not at all! If you can use Google Docs, you can create professional wireframes with Pipewriter. The templates give you just the right amount of design thinking (without the design degree) - in a polished package clients will pay more for. The styles are pre-defined, the spacing is consistent, and the elements just work together. It's like having design guardrails that keep you looking professional without needing to learn design principles."
	// },
	// {
	// 	question: "What if I decide to cancel my subscription?",
	// 	answer: "No problem at all. You can cancel anytime with no hassle. You'll keep Pro access until the end of your billing period, then automatically switch to the free version. Any template packs you've purchased separately remain yours forever. Your documents will continue to work – you just won't have access to Pro-only features for creating new wireframes."
	// },
	// {
	// 	question: "What's the difference between the addon and Pro Template Pack?",
	// 	answer: "The addon is your wireframing studio – it lives in your Google Docs sidebar giving you instant access to UI elements plus all the styling tools, background colors, and export features.<br><br>The Pro Template Pack is like your component library – it's a mega-document with 100+ additional pre-made elements (accordions, testimonials, pricing tables, forms, etc.) in both light and dark variants that you can copy and paste into your own docs. The addon helps you build from scratch, while templates give you a professional headstart."
	// },
	// {
	// 	question: "And what about the Template Store?",
	// 	answer: "While the Pro Template Pack gives you individual components, the Template Store offers complete, ready-to-customize document structures. These are essentially battle-tested wireframes from real client projects – landing pages, full websites, product pages, etc. – that you can purchase individually or in bundles. They're perfect when you need a specific type of page quickly or want inspiration for a particular industry. Think of them as premium shortcuts."
	// },
	// {
	// 	question: "Is this all actually done in Google Docs?",
	// 	answer: "100% yes! Everything you see is built using native Google Docs capabilities - tables, headings, styles, and Apps Script. There's no external design tool involved. The magic happens by leveraging Docs' built-in formatting in ways most people never explore. It's the UX writer's secret weapon - your clients get clean, professional wireframes, and you never have to leave your writing environment."
