		question: "Why build a UX tool in Google Docs?",
		answer: "Because that's where we writers already work! No need to click 5 times in Figma just to edit a headline (with no word counter to save your life). Pipewriter adds UX superpowers to your existing writing workflow, letting you create wireframes and prototypes without leaving your favorite text editor."
	},
	{
		question: "What exactly do I get with Pipewriter?",
		answer: "You get the full template system and Docs sidebar app, with 90+ UI components, pre-formatted documents, and a bunch of styling & conversion scripts - all bound to your documents forever. This includes wireframing tools, HTML export capabilities, and upcoming AI features. All in one Drive that I update regularly. Plus, you'll get direct support and free updates during the beta period."
	},
	{
		question: "Is this just another no-code tool?",
		answer: "No - Pipewriter is specifically built for writers who need to prototype and present content. Unlike Webflow or Wix which focus on final websites, Pipewriter helps you create professional UX deliverables directly in Google Docs. It's perfect for content strategy, UX writing, and high-value copywriting projects."
	},
	{
		question: "How does the HTML export work?",
		answer: "Wireframes are built with styled headings 1-6. There are Docs scripts to convert them to HTML code that AI can understand. Use the selected prompts to get AI help writing and even converting this code to a live website. You can also add comments in the wireframe to increase precision. I'm actively working on improving these integrations. <a href='https://www.loom.com/share/2dd12f155c834c83bdaa3f9e2cb1e011' target='_blank' class='text-primary hover:underline'>Check out this video</a> for a quick demo."
	},
	{
		question: "Can I use this for client work?",
		answer: "Absolutely! It's why I built it for myself. The professional wireframes and UX deliverables help you charge more and reduce revision rounds. It's perfect for freelancers and agencies - use it for as many client projects as you want."
	},
	{
		question: "What does 'lifetime deal' mean exactly?",
		answer: "You get permanent access to everything in the current version: all templates, bound scripts, and updates. Once I launch the Google Docs add-on and webapp, you'll keep access to these foundation features forever, plus get several months of pro membership in the add-on. The core scripts are open-source and bound to your docs, so you can even customize them. Current early-bird price is $57 (reg. $97) until February 28th â€” after that, the lifetime deal goes up permanently."
