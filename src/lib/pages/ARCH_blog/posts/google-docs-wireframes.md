Just finished building something that changes how writers create websites: instant conversion from Google Docs wireframes to production-ready code. No more hand-coding or back-and-forth with developers. Just write, structure, and convert.

## The Power of Headings

Our wireframes use headings for styling and consistency. These structural elements aren't just for organization - they're the blueprint for your final website. With our conversion script, each heading becomes a perfectly styled component in your live site.

## Smart AI Conversion

The magic happens through a specialized prompt that understands document structure and design intent. Add comments to guide the styling, paste your content, and watch as it transforms into clean, production-ready HTML with Tailwind CSS classes.
