# Terms of Service

*Last updated: June 8, 2025*

## Welcome to Pipewriter

These terms govern your use of Pipewriter, the Google Docs add-on that gives writers design superpowers. By using our service, you're agreeing to these terms. If something doesn't sit right with you, please reach out before you start using the service - we're always open to clarifying anything that seems unclear.

**About Us:** Pipewriter OÜ is a company registered in Estonia (Sepapaja 6, Tallinn 15551, reg. no. 14904870) but our heart is with writers everywhere who believe that great products start with great words.

## What Pipewriter Provides

Pipewriter transforms Google Docs into a wireframing and design tool for writers. Our service includes a Google Docs add-on with pre-made elements, premium template documents, and related tools that help you create professional-looking content without leaving your favorite writing environment.

Think of us as the bridge between "BUTTON: BUY NOW!!1!" written in Comic Sans and the polished wireframes that make clients say "wow, these people know what they're doing." Because you do know what you're doing - you just need tools that match your expertise.

## Account Requirements and Access

To use Pipewriter, you need a Google account and must be at least 16 years old. We verify your identity through Google's OAuth system, which means you're using Google's security infrastructure rather than trusting a solo developer with your password (which is better for everyone involved).

You're responsible for keeping your Google account secure. If someone gains unauthorized access to your Google account, they could potentially access your Pipewriter subscription too. We can help you understand what happened, but we can't be responsible for damages from compromised Google accounts.

## Subscription Plans and Billing

### Free Access
You can try Pipewriter with limited access to basic elements and features. This gives you a taste of what's possible when you combine writing expertise with design thinking.

### Trial Period
New users get 14 days of full access to all features at no cost. No payment information required upfront because we're confident you'll see the value once you experience what it's like to create professional wireframes without leaving Google Docs.

### Pro Subscription
Our paid subscription unlocks all elements, premium features, and priority support. We bill monthly or annually through Stripe, and you can cancel anytime without penalty. If you cancel, you keep access through the end of your billing period.

### Premium Templates
In addition to our subscription service, we offer premium template collections - professionally designed Google Docs that you can purchase individually or in bundles. These are separate from the subscription and yours to keep forever once purchased.

### Pricing Changes
We may adjust our pricing with 30 days notice to existing subscribers. We'll never change the price of templates you've already purchased or surprise you with unexpected charges.

## Acceptable Use

You may use Pipewriter for any lawful purpose, including commercial client work. We built this tool for professional writers, so using it to create better deliverables and charge more for your expertise is exactly what we hoped you'd do.

You may not attempt to reverse engineer our add-on, redistribute our templates to others, or use our service to create content that violates others' intellectual property rights. You also can't try to overwhelm our servers or hack into areas you shouldn't access (though honestly, there's not much to hack - we're pretty simple).

If you're using Pipewriter for client work, make sure your clients understand that you're using a third-party tool. Most clients are fine with this (especially when they see the results), but transparency is always the best policy.

## Intellectual Property Rights

### Our Content
The Pipewriter add-on, all template designs, and our brand elements are our intellectual property. You can use our templates in your work and projects, but you can't sell or redistribute the templates themselves to others.

Our goal is to help you create better work, not to restrict how you use that work once it's created. Any content you add to our templates or create using our add-on belongs to you.

### Your Content
You retain full ownership of any content you create. We don't claim rights to your documents, custom prompts, or brilliant copy. We may analyze usage patterns across all users to improve our service, but we don't read individual content or use it for any purpose other than providing you with a better tool.

If you create custom elements or templates using our service, those are yours. If you create something particularly ingenious and want to share it with other users, we'd love to discuss featuring it (with proper attribution and compensation).

## Service Availability and Changes

We work hard to keep Pipewriter running smoothly, but like all internet services, we occasionally need to perform maintenance or deal with unexpected issues. We'll do our best to schedule maintenance during low-usage periods and notify you in advance when possible.

We may add new features, modify existing ones, or occasionally discontinue features that aren't working well for users. We'll give you reasonable notice of any significant changes, especially ones that might affect your workflow.

Since we're a small team, we're pretty responsive to user feedback about what's working and what isn't. If a change we make causes problems for your work, please let us know - we can often find solutions or alternatives.

## Google Integration and Third-Party Services

Pipewriter integrates deeply with Google Docs through official Google APIs. This means your use of our service is also subject to Google's terms of service for Google Workspace and Google Docs. We can't override Google's policies, but we can help you understand how they affect your use of our service.

We use Stripe for payment processing, which means Stripe's terms also apply to billing-related aspects of our service. Firebase (Google's database service) stores your account information under Google's enterprise security standards.

## Privacy and Data Protection

Your privacy matters to us, both as fellow writers who understand the value of confidentiality and as a business that depends on user trust. Our Privacy Policy explains in detail how we collect, use, and protect your information.

The short version: we can insert content into your Google Docs (that's how our add-on works), but we can't read your documents or access your personal Google Drive files beyond what's necessary to provide our service.

## Limitations of Liability

Pipewriter is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. While we work hard to keep everything running smoothly, we can't guarantee that our service will be available 100% of the time or that it will meet every specific need you might have.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, our total liability to you is limited to the amount you've paid us in the 12 months before any issue arose. We're not liable for indirect damages like lost profits or business opportunities, though we'll do everything we can to help resolve any problems that affect your work.

If you're working on a critical project with tight deadlines, we recommend keeping backup plans (as you probably do anyway, being a professional writer who understands that technology sometimes fails at the worst possible moments).

## Termination

### By You
You can cancel your subscription or delete your account at any time. Cancellation takes effect at the end of your billing period, so you won't lose access immediately. If you need to cancel mid-billing period due to exceptional circumstances, contact us and we'll work something out.

### By Us
We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms, engage in abusive behavior toward our support team, or use our service for illegal purposes. We'd much rather work with you to resolve issues than terminate accounts, so we'll typically try to contact you first unless the violation is severe.

If we need to terminate your account, we'll provide reasonable notice and, where appropriate, help you export any custom content you've created.

## Changes to These Terms

We may update these terms as our service evolves or as legal requirements change. We'll notify you of material changes by email and by posting updated terms on our website.

If you don't agree with updated terms, you can cancel your subscription before they take effect. Continued use after the changes go live means you accept the new terms.

## Dispute Resolution

### Let's Talk First
If you have an issue with our service, please contact us directly before considering legal action. Most problems can be resolved through friendly communication, and we're generally pretty reasonable about finding solutions that work for everyone.

### Governing Law
These terms are governed by Estonian law and EU regulations. For any legal disputes that can't be resolved through discussion, Estonian courts have jurisdiction.

### Alternative Resolution
For disputes involving small amounts (under €5,000), we're open to online dispute resolution or mediation rather than formal legal proceedings. It's usually faster and less expensive for everyone involved.

## Contact Information

Questions about these terms? Need clarification on how something works? Just want to share feedback about the service?

**Email:** hello@pipewriter.io

## Final Notes

These Terms of Service, along with our Privacy Policy, constitute the complete agreement between you and Pipewriter. If any part of these terms is found to be unenforceable, the rest of the terms remain in full effect.

We wrote these terms to be as clear and fair as possible while still protecting both of us legally. If anything seems unclear or unreasonable, please reach out - we're always willing to explain our thinking or consider adjustments based on user feedback.

After all, we're all writers here. We understand the importance of clear communication and fair dealing, and we try to run our business accordingly.
