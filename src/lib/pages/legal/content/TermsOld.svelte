    <p>Pipewriter is all about, well, writing. And where there‚Äôs writing, there‚Äôs reading.</p>
    <p>
      So why not take a (very long) moment to read this key legal document that defines the
      relationship between you, wonderful human, and Yours Truly, i.e. Pipewriter?
    </p>
    <p>
      This Terms of Service Agreement (‚Äú<strong>Agreement</strong>‚Äù or ‚Äú<strong>Terms</strong>‚Äù) is
      a contract between ‚Äú<strong>You</strong>‚Äù (the ‚Äú<strong>Customer</strong>‚Äù) and Pipewriter O√ú,
      a flamboyantly picturesque limited liability company registered at Sepapaja 6, Tallinn 15551,
      Estonia, reg. no. 14904870 (‚Äú<strong>We</strong>‚Äù, ‚Äú<strong>Us</strong>‚Äù, ‚Äú<strong
        >Pipewriter</strong
      >‚Äù). As you see, ‚ÄúYours Truly‚Äù shall not be used to refer to Pipewriter hereinafter; that was
      just an opening paragraph gimmick thing.

    <p>Now that we know what's what and who's who, let's dig in.<br /></p>
    <h2><strong>2. General commercial terms</strong></h2>
    <h3><strong>2.1. Product Access</strong></h3>
    <p>
      During the Subscription Term, we will provide you with access to the Product as described in
      this Agreement and based on your chosen Subscription Plan. We might provide some or all
      elements of the Product through third party service providers. We will also request access to
      the third party systems that you use in order for our Product to be able to provide
      integration services to you (namely, Google Docs and Google Drive).<br />
    </p>
    <h3><strong>2.2. Product Availability</strong></h3>
    <p>
      We try to make the Product available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, except for planned
      down-time for maintenance. In addition, our Product availability depends heavily on the
      availability and performance of Google API and other third-party systems you use for
      integration, the type of your Google Account, and established by Google quotas and hard
      limitations: <a
        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230528130033/https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/quotas"
        >https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/quotas</a
      ><br />
    </p>
    <h3><strong>2.3. Service access and availability</strong></h3>
    <p>
      As a writing and creative agency, we are always open to discussing business engagements with
      potential partners, clients or suppliers/contractors. Our availability in that regard varies
      based on our workload and obligations, and cannot be guaranteed at any given time.
    </p>
    <p>
      To inquire about our creative services or to apply as a writer, everyone is free and
      encouraged to email us at <a
        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230528130033/mailto:hello@pipewriter.io"
        >hello@pipewriter.io</a
      > or use other means of contact listed on the Website pipewriter.io.
    </p>
    <h3><strong>2.4. Fees and Payments</strong><br /></h3>
    <h4><strong>2.4.1. Subscription Fees&nbsp;</strong></h4>
    <p>
      The Subscription Fee will remain fixed during the Subscription Term unless you exceed the
      provided as part of your Subscription plan rows or imports limit, or any other applicable
      limit (see the ‚ÄòLimits‚Äô section below).
    </p>
    <p>
      Applicable to all our Subscription Plans, you may decide to upgrade to a new Subscription Plan
      tier in order to increase the allocated limits, or downgrade to any other paid or Free plan at
      any time. There is currently only one tier, but more might be made available in the future. In
      that case, this Agreement shall be promptly updated.<br />
    </p>
    <h4><strong>2.4.2. Service fees</strong></h4>
    <p>
      When you hire Pipewriter to deliver custom creative work (including but not limited to:
      copywriting, UX writing, wireframing, visual design, marketing, social advertising,
      programming and more), fees are determined on a per-case basis, either as flat fees or hourly
      fees. Service Fees for each contract shall be discussed prior to engagement and may be changed
      by common accord by both parties.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      This also applies to Retainers, which are essentially Service Fees to be paid every week,
      month or more for a predefined quantity and quality of services rendered.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the vast majority of cases, Pipewriter will ask for an upfront payment of part of the
      Service Fees or Retainer, usually between 30% and 80% of the total. Prepayment for Services is
      not set in stone and negotiated case by case.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best way to find out what our Service Fees are is to contact us and, you know, hire our
      wonderful services in order to propel your business to new heights. (Note: we do NOT guarantee
      your business will be propelled to new heights, but vow to do our darnest to make that
      happen).<br />
    </p>
    <h4><strong>2.4.3. Payment by credit card</strong></h4>
    <p>
      If you are paying by credit card, you authorize us to charge your credit card or bank account
      for all fees payable during the Subscription Term, Service, or Retainer. You further authorize
      us to use a third party to process payments, and consent to the disclosure of your payment
      information to such third party. For more information about how we treat your payment
      information, please refer to the Privacy Policy at <a
        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230528130033/https://pipewriter.io/privacy"
        >https://pipewriter.io/privacy</a
      >
    </p>
    <h4><strong>2.3.4. Payment Information</strong></h4>
    <p>
      You will keep your contact information, billing information and credit card information (where
      applicable) up to date. You can request and make changes by emailing <a
        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230528130033/mailto:hello@pipewriter.io"
        >hello@pipewriter.io</a
      >. All payment obligations are non-cancelable and all amounts paid are non-refundable, except
      as specifically provided for in this Agreement. All fees are due and payable in advance
      throughout the Subscription Term, while Service fees payment schedule is decided per-case,
      usually with the prepayment conditions outlined in the previous article.<br />
    </p>
    <h3><strong>2.4 Use and Limitation of Use</strong><br /></h3>
    <h4><strong>2.4.1. Prohibited and Unauthorized Use</strong></h4>
    <p>
      You will not <strong>(i)</strong> use or launch any automated system, including, "robots,"
      "spiders," or "offline readers," that sends more request messages to our servers in a given
      period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional
      browser;
      <strong>(ii)</strong>
      use the Product in any manner that damages, disables, overburdens, or impairs our website or interferes
      with any other party's use of the Product; <strong>(iii)</strong> attempt to gain unauthorized
      access to the Product; (iv) access the Product other than through our interface;
      <strong>(iv)</strong>
      use the Product for any purpose or in any manner that is unlawful or prohibited by this Agreement,
      or <strong>(vi)</strong> reverse-engineer the Product.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may not use the Product if you are legally prohibited from receiving or using the Product
      under the laws of the country in which you are resident or from which you access or use the
      Product. (Indeed, copywriting and UX writing are incredibly powerful tools of persuasion,
      which makes it surprising that so many countries still warrant their legality. That was a joke
      right there).
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, you must not resell the Product as-is and when creating End Products (website, app
      etc. wireframes and copy decks), you must follow the directives outlined in Article 2.5
      hereinafter.<br />
    </p>
    <h4><strong>2.4.2. No Sensitive Information</strong></h4>
    <p>
      We will not have any liability that may result from your use of the product to collect, manage
      or process sensitive information.<br />
    </p>
    <h3><strong>2.5. Product License to build End Products</strong></h3>
    <p>
      For the sake of a memory refresher, ‚ÄúProduct‚Äù refers to the Pipewriter Google Docs template,
      related Google Apps Script (the sidebar that enables fast insertion of pre-made wireframing
      elements), and all design assets inside the template and script. (Check the Definitions
      chapter for exact definitions).
    </p>
    <p>
      End Product refers to either a wireframe/copy deck you write and build with the Product, or
      the final website or app that is built from your wireframe/copy deck.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>Here‚Äôs what you can and cannot do with the Product as it concerns the End Product(s):</p>
    <h4>
      <strong>2.5.1. Permitted use of Product to build End Product</strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
      Basically, you can use the template and script to write any number of docs, and do whatever
      you want with those docs:
    </p>
    <ul role="list">
      <li>You may create an End Product for a client or for yourself.</li>
      <li>
        You may sell, license, sublicense or distribute and make any number of copies of the End
        Product.
      </li>
      <li>
        You may modify or manipulate the Product. You may combine the Product with other works and
        make a derivative work from it. The resulting works are subject to the terms of this
        license.
      </li>
      <li>
        This is a 'multi-use' license, which means you may use the Product multiple times, in
        multiple projects. Once you get it, it‚Äôs yours to use on any number of websites, sales
        letters or what have you.<br />
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      <strong>2.5.2. Prohibited use of the Product to build End Product</strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
      This is one of those <strong>don‚Äôt-be-evil</strong> kinds of situations: don‚Äôt resell the full
      Pipewriter or parts of it like it‚Äôs yours. You should only use it to write something amazing and
      sell what you‚Äôve written, instead of piggybacking on our work to make free cash:
    </p>
    <ul role="list">
      <li>
        You can‚Äôt redistribute Product as stock, in a tool or template, or with source files. You
        can‚Äôt do this with the Product either on its own or bundled with other items, even if you
        modify the Product.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can‚Äôt redistribute or make the Item available as-is or with superficial modifications.
      </li>
      <li>
        You must not permit an end user of the End Product to extract the Item and use it separately
        from the End Product. While it‚Äôs unreasonable to delete placeholder design assets or layouts
        you used, it‚Äôd be nice if you could not send copy decks containing every single element in
        the template (by the way, that‚Äôd be clumsy and would drive your clients bananas anyway).
      </li>
      <li>
        The End Product can‚Äôt be used in a product offered for sale where the item contributes to
        the core value of the product being sold. For example, converting a purchased product to a
        template or theme for sale on your website or marketplaces like ThemeForest, Creative
        Market, etc.<br />
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4><strong>2.5.3. Other license elements</strong></h4>
    <ul role="list">
      <li>
        You are not required to attribute or link to Pipewriter in any of your projects, though we
        sure won‚Äôt complain if you mention us (duh!).
      </li>
      <li>
        All Google Drawings in the Product (i.e. placeholder graphics) were built specifically by
        Pipewriter. Some of them resemble commonly-used wireframing elements, but you‚Äôre still
        supposed to not resell them as they are (i.e. outside of an End Product you built/wrote
        yourself).
      </li>
      <li>
        Google Drawings aside, all the rights for photographs and illustrations used in the Product
        are reserved by their legal owners and are presented in the Item for demonstrating purposes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pipewriter will not be responsible for any outcome that may occur during the course of usage
        of our resources.<br />
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      <strong>2.6. Subscription Term, Termination, Suspension</strong><br />
    </h3>
    <h4><strong>2.6.1. Term and Renewal</strong></h4>
    <p>
      Your initial Subscription Term will be specified in your Subscription Plan and will
      automatically renew on each subsequent semi-annual (6 months) or annual anniversary date
      thereafter, unless cancelled or otherwise terminated in accordance to this Agreement. To
      prevent renewal of the subscription, you have to cancel your subscription before the new
      subscription period starts.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you use our Free Product, that‚Äôs a one-off free download that requires no action or renewal
      on your part. The Free Product is updated every once in a while and, while you always get the
      latest version when you download it, to obtain an updated version you will need to download it
      again. In the future we may start automatically notifying Free Product users when a new
      version is available, or emailing it to them directly, but for now it is what it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Subscription Term will end on the expiration date, but the subscription can be canceled at
      any time. We do not provide refunds if you decide to stop using your Product subscription
      before your Subscription Term‚Äôs expiration date.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the paid Product being a template, you‚Äôre essentially free to use it after your
      Subscription period ends: you just won‚Äôt get more updates until you subscribe again, and you
      won‚Äôt get preferential access once the Product evolves into an app.<br />
    </p>
    <h4><strong>2.6.2. Termination and Post-Termination</strong></h4>
    <p>
      Either Party may, upon written notice to the other Party, terminate this Agreement (x) for
      material breach by the other Party if such Party has failed to cure such material breach
      within thirty (30) days of receiving written notice of such material breach from the
      non-breaching Party.; (y) if such termination is required by applicable law, rule or
      regulation; or (z) if the other Party becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any
      other proceeding relating to insolvency, liquidation, or assignment for the benefit of
      creditors, in which case the termination shall take immediate effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall automatically terminate in the event that

    </p>
    <p>
      Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, for any reason, Pipewriter will stop
      providing the Product, and Customer shall promptly cease all access to and use of the Product,
      the Free Subscriptions, the Beta Features, the Website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon written request each Party shall either return to the other Party (or, at such other
      Party‚Äôs instruction, destroy and provide such other Party with written confirmation of the

    <h4><strong>2.6.3. Suspension of the Service</strong></h4>
    <p>
      In addition to its other rights under this Agreement, Pipewriter may suspend the Customer‚Äôs
      access to the Product upon written notice to (a) comply with any law, regulation, court order,
      or other governmental request or order which requires immediate action; or (b) for Customer‚Äôs
      non-payment of the applicable Fees (any amount due), or for (c) any unauthorized use of the
      Product by Customer or any of its authorized Users.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pipewriter will not suspend usage of the Product while you are disputing the applicable
      charges reasonably and in good faith and are cooperating diligently to resolve the dispute. If
      the Product is suspended for non-payment, Pipewriter may, in its sole discretion, charge a
      reactivation fee to reinstate them. You will promptly reimburse Pipewriter for any reasonable
      expenses of collection, including costs, disbursements, and reasonable outside legal fees
      Pipewriter incurs, to the extent necessitated by your refusal to pay amounts that you are not
      disputing in good faith. If suspended, Pipewriter will promptly restore use of the Service to
      Customer as soon as the event giving rise to the suspension has been resolved to Pipewriter‚Äôs
      satisfaction.<br />
    </p>
    <h4><strong>2.6.4. Effect of Termination or Expiration</strong></h4>
    <p>
      If your paid subscription is terminated or expires, you may continue using the (paid) Product
      you have, without access to updates, and you shall remain entitled to obtaining the Free
      Product. However, this may not be the case if your Agreement was terminated for cause. Upon
      termination or expiration of this Agreement, you will stop all use of the Subscription
      Service. If you terminate this Agreement for cause, we will promptly refund any prepaid but
      unused fees covering use of the Subscription Service after termination. If we terminate this
      Agreement for cause, you will promptly pay all unpaid fees due through the end of the
      Subscription Term. Fees are otherwise non-refundable.&nbsp;<br />

    <h2><strong>3. Terms for Product(s) and Services</strong><br /></h2>
    <h3><strong>3.1. Free Product and Subscription Plans</strong></h3>
    <p>
      We offer a Free Product ‚Äì a pre-formatted Google Docs template in one single Google Doc ‚Äì that
      users can download freely. The terms in the hereby Article about licensing in terms of
      building End Products apply to the Free Product as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the paid Product, we offer Subscription Plans, which range from 6 months to 1 year. There
      is no trial period for Subscription Plans, as Customers can test out the limited but still
      highly functional Free version of the Product.&nbsp;<br />
    </p>
    <h3><strong>3.2. Modifications</strong></h3>
    <p>
      We may modify Subscription Plans from time to time, including by adding or deleting features,
      functions, and limits in an effort to improve your experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      For our Paid Subscriptions, we will not make changes that materially reduce the functionality
      provided to you during the Subscription Term.
    </p>
    <p>
      For our Free Subscriptions, we may make changes that materially reduce the functionality
      provided to you during the Subscription Term.<br />
    </p>
    <h3><strong>3.3. Beta Features</strong></h3>
    <p>
      From time to time, you may be able to access and try Product‚Äôs Beta Features. You may choose
      to access such Beta Features at your sole discretion. An important part of our beta process is
      getting real-world testing of the Beta Features before a general release. If you choose to try
      out the Beta Features, the following additional terms and conditions will apply. You will not
      use such Beta Features unless you agree to all such additional terms and conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      You acknowledge that Beta Features (i) are still in development and are provided to you for
      evaluation purposes only and not for production use, (ii) are not considered part of the
      Service or Product under this Agreement, (iii) are not supported, may have bugs or errors, and
      are provided ‚ÄúAS IS‚Äù with no warranties of any kind, and (iv) may be subject to additional
      terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unless otherwise stated, any Beta Feature trial period will expire upon the date that a
      version of the Beta Feature becomes generally available as part of the Service or Product, or
      when Pipewriter elects to discontinue such Beta Feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beta Features may materially change prior to commercial launch, or may never be released
      commercially. Pipewriter may discontinue Beta Features at any time in its sole discretion and
      may never make them generally available.
    </p>
    <p>
      PIPEWRITER WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY HARM OR DAMAGE ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH
      A BETA FEATURE, AND YOUR USE OF OR RELIANCE ON ANY BETA FEATURE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
    </p>

      through chat-based communication systems, if any are available at the time (we continually
      test different support methods). The services are provided in English and are performed
      remotely. We have no set operational hours for support and don‚Äôt guarantee action during a
      certain timeframe, though we vow to respond and help as soon as possible. Support will become
      more standardized at some point in the future, and we will notify Customers and update this
      Agreement whenever changes arise.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may limit or deny your access to support if we determine, in our reasonable discretion,
      that you are acting, or have acted, in a way that results or has resulted in misuse of support
      or abuse of Pipewriter representatives.

    <h3><strong>3.5. Subcontractors</strong></h3>
    <p>

      Customer hereby consents to such use, provided that Pipewriter shall remain solely responsible
      to Customer for the provision of all applicable Services. We encourage writing and other
