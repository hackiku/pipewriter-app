# Privacy Policy

## Who We Are

Pipewriter is built by writers, for writers. We're a small team (okay, mostly just me - Ivan) who believes that copywriters, UX writers, and content strategists deserve product development tools as sophisticated as those used by designers and developers. After all, great products start with great words.

**Company Details:** Pipewriter OÜ, registered at Sepapaja 6, Tallinn 15551, Estonia, reg. no. 14904870. We're incorporated in Estonia but serve writers worldwide who want to create better documents in Google Docs.

## What Pipewriter Does

Pipewriter is a Google Docs add-on that transforms your familiar writing environment into a wireframing and design tool. Think of it as giving Google Docs superpowers for creating professional website copy decks, email templates, and other structured content that looks like it came from a design agency.

Our add-on provides pre-made elements (tables, layouts, components) that you can insert into your documents with one click. We also offer premium templates - standalone Google Docs with professional formatting and wireframe structures that you can purchase and customize for your projects.

## Information We Collect

### When You Sign In
We use Google's authentication system (OAuth) to verify who you are. When you install our add-on, we receive your name, email address, and basic Google account information. We don't get your password - Google handles all the security stuff because they're much better at it than a solo developer who needs sleep (being a biological entity and all).

### How Our Add-On Works
Here's the technical bit: our add-on requires permission to "view and manage your Google Docs documents." This sounds broader than it is. In practice, we only access documents where you've specifically opened our sidebar. We use this permission to insert our pre-made elements at your cursor position - think of it like a really sophisticated copy-paste operation.

**Important clarification:** We cannot and do not read the content of your documents. Our add-on copies tables and layouts from template documents in our Google Drive and pastes them into your document where you click. It's a one-way operation - content flows from our templates to your document, never the other way around.

### Usage and Preferences
We collect information about how you use our add-on to make it better. This includes which elements you insert most often, your preferred themes (light or dark), and any customization settings you choose. We also store any custom prompts or preferences you create within our service to provide you with a personalized experience.

If you purchase our premium templates, we keep records of your purchases and download activity. For subscription users, we track usage patterns to ensure our service remains fast and reliable.

### Automatic Information
Like most web services, we automatically collect some technical information including your device type, browser version, IP address, and how you interact with our add-on. This helps us fix bugs, improve performance, and understand which features are most valuable to our users.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to provide and improve Pipewriter. Specifically, we use it to process your payments through Stripe (our payment processor), provide customer support, send important updates about the service, and develop new features that writers actually want.

For subscription users, we use usage data to optimize performance and ensure fair access to our servers. For template customers, we use purchase history to recommend relevant new templates and bundles.

We may also use your information to send occasional marketing communications about new templates or features, but you can opt out of these at any time. We'll never send you spam or sell your email to other companies.

## Information Sharing

We don't sell your personal information, period. That would be pretty terrible, and we're not in the business of being terrible.

We do share information with a few trusted service providers who help us run Pipewriter. Stripe processes our payments and has their own robust privacy protections. Google provides our authentication and document services. Firebase (part of Google Cloud) stores our user data securely.

We may also share information if required by law or to protect our rights, but we'll fight any unreasonable requests and notify you when legally permitted.

## Data Storage and Security

Your data is stored securely using Google's Firebase platform, which provides enterprise-grade security and encryption. Payment information is handled exclusively by Stripe - we never see or store your credit card details.

Since we're a small team, we take security seriously precisely because we can't afford not to. We implement industry-standard security measures and regularly update our systems. However, no internet service is 100% secure, so we can't guarantee absolute security (nobody can, despite what they might claim in their marketing).

## Your Rights and Control

You have significant control over your information. You can access, correct, or delete your personal information at any time by contacting us. You can also export your custom prompts and settings if you want to keep a local backup.

If you're in the European Union, you have additional rights under GDPR including the right to data portability and the right to restrict processing. If you're in California, you have rights under CCPA including the right to know what personal information we collect and the right to delete it.

You can also revoke our add-on's access to your Google account at any time through your Google account settings. This will disable the add-on but won't delete your Pipewriter account or purchase history.

## Templates and Content Ownership

When you purchase our premium templates, you're buying the right to use them in your projects. The templates themselves remain our intellectual property, but any content you add to them is yours. You can use our templates for client work, internal projects, or personal use, but you can't resell or redistribute the templates themselves.

Any custom prompts, settings, or modifications you create within Pipewriter belong to you. We may analyze usage patterns across all users to improve our service, but we don't read individual custom content or share it with anyone.

## AI and Future Features

We're building AI-powered features to help writers create better content faster. Currently, this includes custom prompt management and planned content generation features. When we add AI capabilities, we may share your prompts with AI service providers, but only the specific text you choose to process - never your entire documents.

We're also developing a web-based editor that will complement our Google Docs add-on. When this launches, it will be covered by this privacy policy with any necessary updates clearly communicated to users.

## International Users and Data Transfers

Pipewriter serves writers worldwide from our base in Estonia. Your information may be processed in the United States (where Google and Stripe operate), the European Union (where we're based), and other countries where our service providers operate.

We ensure that any international data transfers comply with applicable privacy laws including GDPR Article 46 safeguards. Essentially, we only work with service providers who meet European privacy standards regardless of where they're located.

## Changes and Updates

We may update this privacy policy as our service evolves. We'll notify you of material changes by email and by posting the updated policy on our website. The "last updated" date at the top tells you when the policy was last modified.

If we make significant changes that affect how we use your information, we'll give you the opportunity to review the changes before they take effect.

## Contact Us

Have questions about this privacy policy or how we handle your information? We'd genuinely love to hear from you.

**Email:** hello@pipewriter.io  
**Address:** Pipewriter OÜ, Sepapaja 6, Tallinn 15551, Estonia

We typically respond within 24 hours during business days, though sometimes it takes a bit longer when I'm deep in code or dealing with the inevitable challenges of being a solo developer trying to build something useful for fellow writers.

For urgent privacy-related concerns, please mark your email as "Privacy - Urgent" and we'll prioritize it accordingly.
